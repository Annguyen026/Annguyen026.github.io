### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I like to play card games with my friends in real life. Being able to learn how to code this was very fun and interesting. My favorite part was when the class ended, since I was alowed to go home. Going home is my favorite part out of every lab I have done.

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 1 was one of my other favorite labs because it was my first introduction to C++. While taking this lab. I realized that I dislike coding. It hurts my eyes and I don't understand what is going on. Dispite my dislike of coding, I have another class that I dislike even more.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 2 was my favorite due to the fact that this is my last lab. On that note, I am happy that I don't have a lab next week during finals. You might be wondering what class I dislike more than this one, it's ASAM 325. She hasn't graded any of my assignments and classmates' assignments since March, then accused half of the class of plagerism with the use of Chat GPT. I'm going to have a blast filling out the questionaire for that class.
